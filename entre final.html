    <p class="mt-21 text-lg" style="color:brown"> We have to be able to self-reflect, to change the way that we look at ourselves, and thus the world. Self-reflection involves one looking into themselves and asking what they honestly see within them. Philosophers like Socrates and Plato are considered key figures in the philosophy of self-reflection, with Plato exploring the desire of self-reflection and its importance in the pursuit of knowledge.</p>

        <p style="color: rgb(225, 143, 156)">Self-reflection, its importance is unmatched. We have to be able to self-reflect, 
            to change the way that we look at ourselves, and thus the world. Self-reflection 
            involves one looking into themselves and asking what they honestly see in themselves.

        <p style="color:forestgreen">Looking back on the school year, I find my drive for furthering my knowledge meaningful, and I hope to keep that as a trait of mine for the rest of my academic career. I also found learning from mistakes, doing work on time, having a schedule for life, and learning from those that have more knowledge than me important. This past year I‚Äôve been in spaces that allow me to explore these topics and, hopefully, live a meaningful life in the future.  </p>

        <p style="color: rgb(236, 79, 79)">This school year, I have learned a lot about myself, feeding into the importance of self-reflection and the drive to reflect on oneself. If I could do anything differently, I would have managed my time better and payed attention to key details. In regular life, I am pretty vigilant of everything, but this year showed me that it does not always carry over. Going forward, I am going to make an extreme effort to organize myself and my thoughts to better ensure that I can make deadlines and not forget about things.</p>

        <p style="color: rgb(101, 218, 245)">One of the main goals I accomplished was that I got into one of the top 3 schools on my list of colleges. I also feel like I learned a lot in most of my classes, and I think I performed well with my poor time management skills in thought.</p>

        <p style="color: rgb(108, 108, 246)">My most memorable experience was me going to Afro Tech, which is a multicultural tech themed conference, specifically focusing on the Black tech community. This experience taught me the power of networking and meeting people in positions higher than mine. It also taught me the power of knowledge and the places it can take me, as being at Afro Tech put me in places where I was in the same rooms as people running and owning multi-million-dollar conglomerates; with us all being there for the same reason, for the pursuit of knowledge.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2" style="color:rgb(200, 151, 86)">üìú Quote That Exemplifies Me</h2>
        <blockquote class="italic border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 text-lg">
          ‚ÄúWisdom is not a product of schooling, but of the lifelong attempt to acquire it.‚Äù ‚Äì Albert Einstein
        </blockquote>
        <p class="mt-2" style="color: rgb(197, 167, 127)">This quote explains that wisdom comes from lifelong experiences rather that only what is taught. While taught knowledge is important for life, the experiences we live through may teach us more than what we are taught directly. This quote also encapsulates the idea that education goes beyond the accumulation of knowledge, but also includes critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills; many of which cannot be taught, but have to be lived through. </p>

        <p style="color:rgb(79, 79, 79)">The best advice I could give future students would be to pursue knowledge and experiences that are outside of school. Many experiences and opportunities will teach you more about yourself and who you want to be in other areas of life.</p>
